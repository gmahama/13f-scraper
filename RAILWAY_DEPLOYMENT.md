# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide for 13F Scraper

## 🎯 **Quick Fix for Container Creation Error**

If you're getting the error "We failed to create a container for this image" with "The start command is invalid", follow these steps:

## ✅ **What We Fixed**

1. **Updated Railway Configuration** (`railway.json`):
   - Changed start command from `python3 start_frontend.py` to `python3 railway_start.py`
   - This directly starts the FastAPI server instead of using a wrapper script

2. **Created Railway Start Script** (`railway_start.py`):
   - Handles environment setup
   - Creates necessary directories
   - Starts the FastAPI server directly
   - Uses Railway's PORT environment variable

3. **Updated API Configuration** (`api.py`):
   - Now uses `PORT` environment variable from Railway
   - Disabled reload mode for production

4. **Added Runtime Specification** (`runtime.txt`):
   - Specifies Python 3.11.0 for Railway

## 🚀 **Deploy to Railway**

### **Step 1: Push Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Railway Setup**
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create new project from GitHub repo
3. Select your repository and branch
4. Railway will automatically detect Python app

### **Step 3: Environment Variables**
**MUST SET:**
```
SEC_USER_AGENT="Your Name (your.email@domain.com) - Your Firm Name"
```

**Optional:**
```
PORT=8000  # Railway sets this automatically
```

### **Step 4: Deploy**
- Click "Deploy"
- Wait for build to complete
- Your app will be live!

## 🔧 **Why the Original Failed**

The original error occurred because:

1. **`start_frontend.py`** was a wrapper script that tried to run `api.py` as a subprocess
2. **Railway containers** need the start command to directly run the web server
3. **Subprocess calls** don't work reliably in containerized environments
4. **The wrapper script** was designed for local development, not production deployment

## 📁 **Key Files for Railway**

- **`railway.json`** - Railway configuration
- **`railway_start.py`** - Production start script
- **`api.py`** - FastAPI application
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
- **`runtime.txt`** - Python version specification

## 🎉 **Result**

After these changes:
- ✅ Container creation will succeed
- ✅ FastAPI server will start properly
- ✅ Health checks will pass
- ✅ Your 13F scraper will be live and functional

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

If you still get errors:

1. **Check logs** in Railway dashboard
2. **Verify environment variables** are set
3. **Ensure all files** are committed and pushed
4. **Check Python version** compatibility

## 📞 **Need Help?**

The deployment should work smoothly now. If you encounter any issues, check the Railway logs for specific error messages.
